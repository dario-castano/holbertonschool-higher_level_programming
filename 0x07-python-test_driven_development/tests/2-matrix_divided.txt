matrix_divided - A function who divides a matrix by a scalar.

Note:
     elements in matrix must be the same size.

Args:
    matrix (list): List of lists.
    div (int or float): Scalar used to divide each element.

Returns:
    list: an scalar division rounded up to 2 decimals if successful,
        otherwise raises an exception.

Raises:
    TypeError:
        When matrix is not a matrix (list of lists of int or floats).
        When divisor is not an int or float
        When internal lists (rows) has different sizes
        When div is not a float or int
    ZeroDivisionError:
        When the user tries to perform a division by zero

Examples:
    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
    >>> divisor = 3
